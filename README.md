COMP 3004 Final Project Team 66

Team Members:
Rhys Martin,
Sahel Reza,
Rayhan Moraldo,

Responsibilities:
Rhys Martin: Implementation of Qt and C++ code, User Case + OO design model, and test code
Sahel Reza: Test + traceability matrix, assist with implementation of Qt and C++ code and test code
Rayhan Moraldo: Use Case + OO design model, assist with traceability matrix and test code

To use QtCharts in the program:
Open your terminal and type 'sudo apt install libqt5charts5-dev' to download the library.
NOTE: When running the project for the first time, you might have to try to run it twice, I think this
is due to the qmake being remade the first time for the new library.
